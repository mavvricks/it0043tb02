                Doraemon (Japanese: ドラえもん) is a fictional character in the Japanese manga and anime series of the same
                name created by Fujiko F. Fujio. Doraemon is a male robotic earless cat that travels back in time from
                the 22nd century to aid a preteen boy named Nobita. An official birth certificate for the character
                gives him a birth date of 3 September 2112 and lists his city of residency as Kawasaki, Kanagawa, the
                city where the manga was created.[6] In 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry appointed Doraemon the country's
                "anime ambassador".

            <p class="text-info">
                Doraemon's physical appearance changed as the manga progressed. At first, he was predominantly kingfish
                color, with a blue tail, a white stomach, and flesh-colored hands and feet. He also stooped, and had a
                body much larger than his head. In later issues, he sported a smaller body, white hands and feet, and a
                red tail — the appearance most identified with him today.

            <h1 class="text-content two">Creation</h1>
            <p class="text-info">
                Doraemon was originally conceived by Hiroshi Fujimoto following a series of three events. Firstly, when
                searching for ideas for a new manga, he wished that a machine existed that would come up with ideas for
                him. Secondly, he tripped over his daughter's toy. Thirdly, he heard cats fighting in his neighborhood.
